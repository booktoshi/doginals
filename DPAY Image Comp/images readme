## Usage

To compress an image to a specified size, run the `compress_image.py` script:

```sh
python compress_image.py input_image output_image target_size
```

- `input_image`: Path to the input image file.
- `output_image`: Path to save the compressed image file.
- `target_size`: Target size in KB.

Example:

```sh
python compress_image.py input.jpg output.jpg 25
```
```

**`requirements.txt`**

```
Pillow
```

**`compress_image.py`**

```python
import os
import sys
from PIL import Image

def compress_image(input_path, output_path, target_size_kb):
    image = Image.open(input_path)
    target_size = target_size_kb * 1024  # Convert KB to bytes

    # Perform binary search on the quality to achieve the target file size
    min_quality = 10
    max_quality = 95
    while min_quality <= max_quality:
        quality = (min_quality + max_quality) // 2
        image.save('/tmp/temp_compressed.jpg', 'JPEG', quality=quality)
        file_size = os.path.getsize('/tmp/temp_compressed.jpg')

        if file_size < target_size:
            min_quality = quality + 1
        else:
            max_quality = quality - 1

    # Save the final image
    image.save(output_path, 'JPEG', quality=max_quality)
    print(f"Image saved to {output_path} with quality {max_quality}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    if len(sys.argv) != 4:
        print("Usage: python compress_image.py input_image output_image target_size")
        sys.exit(1)

    input_image = sys.argv[1]
    output_image = sys.argv[2]
    target_size_kb = int(sys.argv[3])

    compress_image(input_image, output_image, target_size_kb)
```

#### 5. Install the Required Packages

Before running the script, you need to install the required Python packages. Run the following command:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 6. Add, Commit, and Push the Changes

Add the files to the repository, commit the changes, and push to GitHub:

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push origin main
```

#### 7. Verify the Repository

Go back to your GitHub repository page and verify that all the files have been uploaded correctly.

### Usage Example

To use the script, run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
python compress_image.py input.jpg output.jpg 25
```

- Replace `input.jpg` with the path to your input image file.
- Replace `output.jpg` with the path where you want to save the compressed image.
- Replace `25` with the desired file size in KB.

This command will compress the input image to approximately 25KB and save it to the specified output path.

### Summary

By following these steps, you will have a GitHub repository containing a script to compress images to a specified file size. The repository will include a README file with instructions, a requirements file for dependencies, and the Python script for the image compression.
